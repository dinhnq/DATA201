    "The Little Spotted Kiwi (Apteryx owenii) is one of the 5 species of kiwi. We are lucky enough to have them living close to us, in Zealandia sanctuary up in Karori. They are lovely birds as you can see here: ![LSK](LSK1.jpg). \n",

In Zealandia, Raewyn Empson has been getting volunteers to perform kiwi call counts every summer since the kiwi were translocated to the valley in 2001 and 2002. Knowing how many calls there are doesn't tell us so much about the number of birds unless we can assume that the number of calls increases linearly with the number of birds, which it probably doesn't. But it does reassure us that they are alive and doing OK.\n",
