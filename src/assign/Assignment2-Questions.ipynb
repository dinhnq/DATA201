    "1\\. A genetics company offers to analyse the DNA of clients who submit a biological sample for analysis (a self-collected saliva sample, sent through the post).  The clients also complete a short health questionnaire.  After carrying out the analysis they return by email a report to the client, describing details of their genetic background.  In the report they also notify the client about any genetic markers they have for diseases that they might develop later in life, or that they might possibly pass on to their children.  The genetic profile and health questionnaire results from every client are added to a research database of genome data, but without any information that identifies the client.  Scientific research reports based on the data are published from time to time by health researchers who are granted access.\n",
