    "1\\. A genetics company offers to analyse the DNA of clients who submit a biological sample for analysis (a self-collected saliva sample, sent through the post).  The clients also complete a short health questionnaire.  After carrying out the analysis they return by email a report to the client, describing details of their genetic background.  In the report they also notify the client about any genetic markers they have for diseases that they might develop later in life, or that they might possibly pass on to their children.  The genetic profile and health questionnaire results from every client are added to a research database of genome data, but without any information that identifies the client.  Scientific research reports based on the data are published from time to time by health researchers who are granted access.\n",

    "There are some issues in privacy relating to the self-collected savilla sample and the health questionnaire. The sample must be kept and used only for what the genetics company exactly tells their clients and must be disposed afterwards. The questionnaire must not include invasive questions, especially not too involved in their personal lives. In security, sensitive genetic data of clients must be protected from being disclosed. Although security has been set up in the process of publishing data from time to time by the right staff with relevant permissions, security must include the supervising process of those data collection, transmission and storage. The company has shown its duty of confidentiality to the clients as identity-related information would not be saved in the same place of the genetic profile and health questionnaire. However, the sensitive data must be anonymized or aggregated to prevent identification from unexpected intruders. For example, the date of birth could be converted to age and then to age band.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b) It is ethical for them not to inform their close relatives if a client discovers that they have a marker for a heritable disease. There are many reasons to consider that action is ethical. From their viewpoint, the result they receive is actually only a reference for their genetic health offered as a product of a company. It means there is no public request from government that they have to let their close relatives know. Another reason is that they could be not so sure about the accuracy level of this genetic technology and it would be a great mistake to tell their family if the report is discovered incorrect. In that case, they would be possibly considered unethical to tell their family the bad news.\n"
